Prework Study Guide Webpage
Description
Created a webpage to display notes for assistance with my course. I will use this as reference and add to it throughout the course when more information becomes available. This does away with the need to use antiquated technology like using a stylus to transcribe notes on papyrus. I have attempted to learn the utter basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git and hopefully with the aid of this study guide learn more about said topics.

Installation
N/A

Usage
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
