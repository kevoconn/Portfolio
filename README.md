#Description

Created a portfolio to display my work in a clean and orderly manner to send to prospective employers. This portfolio uses just HTML and CSS.

#My experience

As someone who has had no experience in the coding world to speak of, I found this project challenging but quite enjoyable. Figuring out how to code HTML and style using CSS was a lot of fun. Infuriating at times, but fun.
